# Gunung Elang Indah

This repository, gunung-elang-indah, is the frontend side of a website we (me and my team) are currently working on. It is primarily written in TypeScript and is publicly accessible.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
